Match City
=====================

Match City is a tile matching game. There are 12 different tiles, and a couple of special ones, explained further below. The basic tiles have numbers on them, once they are placed on the field. If you manage to get at least three tiles  of the same color touching each other on the field, they will combine into the the tile that you last placed (Cumulating their respective levels). Goal of the game is, to score as many points as possible. This requires you to manage your space on the playing field and (ideally) try to stack your multiplier. 

Basics
-----
Every time you tap on the field, your first "next tile" will be placed in that spot (provided, it is empty of course). If at least three tiles of the same color touch each other, they will contract into the last placed tile - cumulating the points and adding them to your score (after multiplying by 10, and whatever your current multiplier happens to be).
Grey tiles are essentially just a blocking tile - they dont combine, they just take up space on the playing field.

Random spawns
-----
In the bottom right you can see which tiles are going to spawn randomly on your field after a set amount of turns (also indicated in the bottom bar). By matching tiles, the random spawn counter gets delayed.

Combos
-------
In the top right corner you see two numbers, eg 4 x 12. This would mean that you have a multiplier of 12 which is active for the next 4 turns. You can increase your multiplier, by matching more tiles during your combo. If you let the left number get to 0, your multiplier will reset, but preserving your multiplier is extremly beneficial in order to get a high score.

Power Ups
---------
Special fields have a crown on them. Three crowns will combine into one of three powerups, that will stay on the playing field. You are free to choose when to activate it, but it takes up one tile on the playing filed. Activation will not count as a "turn", which means your comboturns won't be diminished by it. The current powerups are:

[T]NT - will destroy one random grey block from the playing field. <br>
[S]WAP - will swap your first two tiles <br>
[R]ESET - combines all colors on the field.
