Match City
=====================

Goal of the game is, to score as many points as possible. This requires you to manage your space on the playing field and (ideally) try to stack your multiplier. 

Basics
-----
Every time you tap on the field, your first "next tile" will be placed in that spot (provided, it is empty of course). If at least three tiles of the same color touch each other, they will contract into the last placed tile - cumulating the points and adding them to your score (after multiplying by 10, and whatever your current multiplier happens to be).

Random spawns
-----
In the bottom right you can see which tiles are going to spawn randomly on your field after a set amount of turns (also indicated in the bottom bar). By matching tiles, the random spawn counter gets delayed.

Combos
-------
In the top right corner you see two numbers, eg 4 x 12. This would mean that you have a multiplier of 12 which is active for the next 4 turns. You can increase your multiplier, by matching more tiles during your combo. If you let the left number get to 0, your multiplier will reset, but preserving your multiplier is extremly beneficial in order to get a high score.
