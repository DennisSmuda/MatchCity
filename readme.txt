 Data:
 Houses give Citizens
 

 All important information is directly visible in the main screen.
 At the top you will see your current net worth. Underneath is the
 empty city, and at the bottom are buttons to buy/upgrade.
 
 
  Gameplay:
 You start with an all empty field where you can begin to build and 
 manage your city. The first tile you place is your Government tile.
 There can only be one [G] tile.
 
 Government tile is randomly placed [not set in stone yet)
 
 
 1. First, you need citizens. These need [H]ousing of course.

 These citizens are going to have needs that you will have to meet.
 In order to do so you will have to connect your [H]ousing fields
 to other field areas to give them access.
 
 Needs include (besides a home, of course) Jobs, Food, Recreation,
 Shopping. They need access to the power network (which is handled through 
 streets).
 
 2. Build Industry, Power and Shops to allow your citizens to make a living.
 These are necessary needs to keep your citizens in your city.
 
 3. Make them happy?
 Happy Citizens will work better and are a better buying force.
 (they produce more money - so making them happy is worth it).

4. You need to manage Garbage. Each building produces trash that 
has to be taken care of. Garbage technology should be very expensive.
Citizens who live near [T]rash are not happy.
 
 ===============
 Implementation:
 
 
 spawn a random amount of roads at the start.
 make it mandatory for the player to connect and utilize these roads.
 to do so he has to purchase more roads with money
